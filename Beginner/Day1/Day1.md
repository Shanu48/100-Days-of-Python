# Day 1

The first question that comes to mind is, what editor to use to start with the coding.

On **day 15** we will learn how to install and setup PyCharm which is the most popular local python code editor.

Till then we will be using **Replit**, a browser based code editor. This has a number of advantages:
1. We can get up and running immediately, with less time wasted on setup and troubleshooting, more time learning to code.
2. It's accessible anywhere, any computer/iPad/phone that's connected to the internet can be used to code.
3. Your code and progress are saved, ready for you to review and revisit at any time.
4. It's free.
