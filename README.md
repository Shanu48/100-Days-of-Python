# 100-Days-of-Python

Using the repo I am starting my journey of learing python for 100 days. This is my first 100 days of Coding challenge.

I decided that in these 100 days I will be learing python from the very basic to the very advanced. This repo can in a way act as a complete guide to learning python.

For starters, the course is devided into 4 levels. Depending on how much you already know python you can directly start there

1. Beginner
2. Intermediate
3. Advanced
4. Professional
